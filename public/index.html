                <h2>Tax Reform</h2>
                <p>Tax reform can play a significant role in addressing housing affordability in the United States by influencing both supply and demand factors. Some ways it could help are:   </p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Incentivizing Affordable Housing Development:<br> Tax incentives for developers who build affordable housing units can significantly increase the supply of affordable housing, helping to lower prices and improve affordability for low- and moderate-income individuals and families.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Property Tax Policies:<br> Reforming property tax policies, such as implementing exemptions or caps on property tax increases, can help protect long-term residents from displacement in gentrifying neighborhoods and alleviate financial burdens on homeowners, particularly those with low incomes.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Tax Credits for Low-Income Homebuyers:<br> Providing tax credits or deductions for low-income individuals or families purchasing their first homes can help reduce the financial barrier to homeownership and promote wealth-building among disadvantaged communities.</li>

            <div class="container">
                <h2>Housing Supply</h2>
                <p>We can advocate for the increase in supply of houses in the United States. Ways this can help are: </p>
                <ul class="list-group">
                    <li class="list-group-item">Meeting Demand:<br> Increasing housing supply helps to meet the demand for housing, which can stabilize or reduce housing prices, benefiting both renters and potential homebuyers.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Alleviating Pressure on Low- and Moderate-Income Households:<br> A larger supply of affordable housing options can provide more choices for low- and moderate-income households, helping to alleviate their housing cost burdens.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item">Preventing Gentrification and Displacement:<br> Increasing housing supply in areas experiencing rapid development or gentrification can mitigate displacement by providing alternative housing options, preserving neighborhood diversity, and preventing the exclusion of low-income residents.</li>

                <h2>Budget Calculator Section</h2>
                <p>It is important to remember key factors to be aware of when looking into an increasingly costly housing market: </p>
                <ul class="list-unstyled">
                <li><b>Down Payment:</b> Saving for a down payment is essential, as it's typically required upfront and can significantly impact affordability.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Mortgage Payments:</b> Calculating mortgage payments accurately is crucial to ensure they fit within your budget and include principal, interest, taxes, and insurance (PITI).</li><br>
                    <li><b>Property Taxes:</b> Understanding property tax rates in the area you're buying and anticipating potential increases is important for budgeting purposes.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Homeowners Insurance:</b> Obtaining insurance quotes and including the cost of homeowners insurance in your budget is essential to protect your home and belongings.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI):</b> If your down payment is less than 20%, budgeting for PMI, which adds to your monthly mortgage payments, is necessary.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Home Maintenance and Repairs:</b> Budgeting for ongoing maintenance and setting aside funds for unexpected repairs can prevent financial strain as a homeowner.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Utilities and Other Expenses:</b> Accounting for utilities, HOA fees, landscaping, and furnishings in your budget is important for accurately estimating homeownership costs.</li><br>
                    <li><b>Emergency Fund:</b> Building and maintaining an emergency fund with three to six months' worth of living expenses is crucial to cover unexpected homeownership expenses or financial setbacks.</li>
